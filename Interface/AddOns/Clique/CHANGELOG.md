- Merge pull request #5 from jnwhiteh/import-export  
    Add support for importing and exporting bindings  
- Add support for importing and exporting bindings  
    This only covers the actual bindings, and will only export your  
    current set of bindings if you have set up to automatically change  
    based on spec.  
    Please be careful with this feature, as it directly overwrites your  
    current bindings with the imported version.  
    You can access this feature on the Clique general options page under  
    the UI options menu (not the Clique config).
